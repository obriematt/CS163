//Matthew O'Brien
//Assignment 2

//This "main" file will be used to test out the ADTs built in the header and other cpp files.
//It's function will be to build up the lists of stores, products, and features in order to run the
//functions of the ADTs and show that they work with real data.

//Obviously there is nothing here. I was unable to build the test function to be able to really test my code for each of the ADTs
//Due to midterms, and initially making this assignment overly complicated, I changed my thought process for this assignment many many times.
//This led to remaking all of my classes a few times. And when it was all said and done, I was only able to build up the functions for the ADTs. 
//Hopefully you, the grader, is able to search through my code and let me know if my thought process was along the right track. I would really like to know if what I was doing
//would have actually worked, if I had the correct database to work with and test my ADTs.
